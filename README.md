Interactive guide to operating the MOKE microscope using Augmented Reality.

The primary objective of this thesis was to develop an AR application that serves as an onboarding tool for users of the MOKE microscope. The application, built using Unity and deployed on the HoloLens 2 platform, guides users through the process of configuring and operating the microscope in various experimental setups. 

To connect Unity and HoloLens 2 HMD, Microsoft's Mixed Reality Toolik (MRTK) was used.

There is a release with .apk package that could be deployed to the HoloLens 2 goggles.
